#
# To start, you can copy this file to one called "general.yml" in the same

# FixMyStreet uses a templating cobrand system to provide different looks for
# different installations. In the common case, if your templates are in the
# templates/web/moon directory and CSS in web/cobrands/moon, you just specify:
#   ALLOWED_COBRANDS:
#     - moon
# If you wish to use multiple cobrands, specify them in a list, optionally with
# hostname-matching regular expressions if the name of the cobrand is not
# enough. For example:
#   ALLOWED_COBRANDS:
#     - moon
#     - venus
# Any hostname with 'moon' in it will use the moon cobrand, any with 'venus'
# the venus cobrand (any other the Default cobrand). Whereas:
#   ALLOWED_COBRANDS:
#     - moon: 'orbital'
#     - venus
# Any hostname with 'orbital' in it will use the moon cobrand.
# This also allows development servers to map to different cobrands if needed,
# using DNS subdomains for example.
ALLOWED_COBRANDS:
  - fixmystreets
#  - cobrand1
#  - cobrand2: 'hostname_substring2'
